        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose-flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder, <em>aluminum free</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, <em>make sure it's cold</em></li>
            <li>1 cup half and half, <em>minus 2 tablespoons</em></li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon melted butter, <em>to brush baked biscuits</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Make biscuit dough:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Dice butter into 1/2 inch cubes and refrigerate until needed.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour baking powder, sugar and salt. Whisk thoroughly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add diced cold butter and blend, or whisk, until butter pieces are pea-sized.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add half and half all at once and stir until dough comes together and is moist. <em>Don't over mix.</em></p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Fold dough and cut biscuits:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Turn dough on a floured surface. If dough is very sticky, sprinkle it with flour.</p></li>
            <li><p>Form dough into a rectangle then fold, forming another rectangle. Fold a second time into a rectangle. Dip a biscuit cutter,
            or an appropriately sized cup, into flour and cut out 8 biscuits. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Pull together scraps, if any, and form into a rectangle. Cut out additional biscuit(s).</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Bake biscuits:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Place biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper 1 inch apart.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake at 450ËšF for 12-15 minutes or until the top of the biscuits are golden brown and baked all the way through.</p></li>
            <li><p>While the biscuits are hot, brush the tops with the melted butter. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p></li>
        </ol>
